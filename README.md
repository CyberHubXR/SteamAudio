# Steam Audio For Foundry
This is a copy of the [Steam Audio plugin for Unity](https://valvesoftware.github.io/steam-audio/downloads.html)
created for easier distribution and installation in Foundry. A refactor is currently needed to make this optional
and configurable rather then the baked-in required dependency as it currently is.
